Dear Mr. Liao:

I am going to make a conversion to CS area. I have learned your git courses and python courses, and they are really helpful to me. 
I am going to learn your SQL courses and Java courses in the future.
You are so kind and talented, I do really appreciate that you share these courses.
I hope you everything goes well.
